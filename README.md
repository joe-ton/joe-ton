Hi, I'm Joe Ton. I'm a full-stack AI systems engineer focused on solutions architecture, based in Washington State. My experience includes system-level programming, machine learning pipelines, and full-stack development â€” with current interests in edge computing, vector databases, AI infrastructure, and exploring MCP (Model Context Protocol).

I use this GitHub account for collaborations (open source), my website (tonindustries.com), daily practice (ai-daily), and tooling (neovim, alacritty, Makefiles). My personal stuff is kept elsewhere under different usernames.

If you're interested in systems engineering, product development, or architecting end-to-end AI pipelines, feel free to reach out!
