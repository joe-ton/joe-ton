# 👋 joe-ton

Hi, I'm Joe Ton. I am an AI Infrastructure Engineer.

I use this GitHub account for collaborations (open source), my website (tonindustries.com), daily practice (ai-daily), and tooling (neovim, alacritty, Makefiles). My personal stuff is kept elsewhere under different usernames.

If you're interested in systems engineering, product development, or architecting end-to-end AI pipelines, feel free to reach out!
