# 👋 joe-ton

Hello, I'm Joe Ton. I'm a full-stack systems engineer and aspiring solutions architect based in Washington State. My expertise spans across system-level programming, machine learning pipelines, and full-stack development — with a growing focus on edge computing, vector databases, and AI infrastructure.

I’m currently working on:
- ⚙️ A Rust-based vector database optimized for Edge AI
- 📱 SyncUp – A privacy-first productivity SMS assistant built with Flutter + Rust
- 🧠 Internal payment systems and backend architecture for fintech & insurance use cases

I use this GitHub primarily to share open-source projects and experiments across the stack — from C++ GPU compiler tuning to TypeScript product interfaces. I believe in building with purpose and transparency, and I'm currently exploring ways to bridge business value with technical architecture at scale.

If you're into systems engineering, product dev, or architecting end-to-end AI pipelines, let's connect!
